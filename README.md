A basic stack-based language which utilizes stack operations, similar to Forth, to perform arithmetic and logical operations. It includes features such as conditionals, loops, macros with more to come. The language has more than one stack to provide loop functionality and 
uses a dictionary to provide the ability to define and call macros.

The language is designed to run from GHCI loading stack.hs.

A very brief (2-3 sentence) introduction to your language. This should include its name of your language, the languageâ€™s paradigm, and the most interesting features you decided to include.

Instructions for how to execute example programs in your language. Specifically:

    If your language implementation is intended to be run from GHCi, which module should be loaded?

    If your language implementation is intended to be run from the command line, what command (precisely) should be executed?

    You should provide the precise commands needed (in GHCi or the command line) to execute both your good examples and your bad examples, together with the expected output. If the expected output for many bad examples are the same, you can combine these into one example.
